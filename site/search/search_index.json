As such, it can be a more convenient alternative to arranging an in-person visit for many computer issues.\n\n\nThis guide describes how to download and run TeamViewer in order to initiate a remote support session.\n\n\nArranging a remote support session\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore you can download TeamViewer and join a remote support session, the first thing you will need to do is arrange a time for your session to take place. The best way to do this is often to talk to a technician you trust.\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nFor your security, we will not initiate a remote support session without explicit permission.\n If someone you do not trust contacts you offering remote support, you should decline. You should also decline if you are not requesting support. Allowing unsolicited remote support sessions risks the safety of your computer, of information, and of your identity.\n\n\nUsing QuickSupport on Windows\n\u00b6\n\n\nDownload and run QuickSupport\n\u00b6\n\n\nPrior to beginning your remote support session, you need to download and run TeamViewer\n\n\nTo download TeamViewer QuickSupport, \nclick here\n. You can also copy and paste this link into your web browser: \nhttp://go.nerdoncloud.com/teamviewer\n.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\n\nThe next two steps are for Google Chrome only. Different web browsers may ask you to either Save or Run the file. If asked, you should \nSave\n the file, and then move it to your \nDesktop\n.\n\n\nAfter the download finishes, locate it in the bar at the bottom of the window. Click the \narrow\n to the right of the file name, and select \nShow in folder\n.\n\n\n\n\nMove the file out of this folder by dragging and dropping it onto your \nDesktop\n. Close the folder window If desired.\n\n\nright-click\n the downloaded file. Click \nRun as administrator\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nRun\n to accept the security warning.\n\n\n\n\nIf a User Account Control window appears, click \nYes\n, and provide an administrator password if needed.\n\n\nEstablishing a TeamViewer Session\n\n\nThe TeamViewer window will now appear. Note the \ngreen light\n towards the bottom of the window, as well as the status, \"Ready to connect (secure connection).\" This indicates that TeamViewer is now able to accept an incoming remote support offer.\n\n\nMake a note of \nyour ID\n and the four-digit temporary \npassword\n (obscured), which the support staff will need in order to securely connect to your computer.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the support technician has this information, they can take temporary control of your computer. You will be able to see every action they perform. This typically includes seeing the mouse cursor moving, and seeing programs opening and closing. While the technician has control over the mouse and keyboard, you can still override their actions by using the mouse or the keyboard yourself. This is useful when replicating an issue for support staff to resolve, and when you need to enter a password.\n\n\nIf you want to stop a support session in-progress, close TeamViewer. Your technician can also end the session at any time.\n\n\nOnce the remote support session is over, TeamViewer will automatically return control of your computer to you.\n\n\nAlways close TeamViewer once your remote support session is finished. This ensures that no one can access your computer remotely unless TeamViewer is opened again.\n\n\n\n\nSponsored sessions\n\n\nWhen the support session ends, you may see messages promoting the paid edition of TeamViewer. These often appear as a \nsponsored session\n message. TeamViewer shows these messages at random because we can provide remote support at no cost to you.\n\n\nIf you see any promotional messages, you can \nclose\n these windows and continue using your computer, with no further action required.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, or to arrange a remote support session, please email our dedicated support staff at \nsupport@nerdoncloud.com\n.\n\n\nUsing QuickSupport for Mac (OS X)\n\u00b6\n\n\nDownloading and Running TeamViewer\n\n\nPrior to beginning your remote support session, the TeamViewer program will first need to be downloaded and run from your computer. While TeamViewer QuickSupport is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, for your convenience, the link below will automatically detect which version is best for your device.\n\n\nTo download TeamViewer, \nclick here\n. Alternatively, copy and paste the following link into your browser's address bar: \nhttp://go.nerdoncloud.com/teamviewer\n.\n\n\nDepending upon the operating system and browser you use, you may be prompted to either run the file or save it. In this example we are using OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Google Chrome. For other operating systems, the options may look slightly different; however, the basic procedure is the same on almost every Mac.\n\n\nAfter the download finishes, locate it in the bar at the bottom of the window Click the \narrow\n to the right of TeamViewerQS.dmg, and select \nShow in Finder\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Finder window that appears double-click \nTeamViewerQS.dmg\n to open it.\n\n\n\n\nNext, double-click the \nQuickSupport icon\n to open it when prompted.\n\n\n\n\nIf prompted, click \nOpen\n to accept the security warning.
