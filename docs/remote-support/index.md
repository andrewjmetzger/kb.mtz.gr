# Getting Started with Remote Support

Before you can join a remote support session, the first thing you will need to do is arrange a time for your session to take place. The best way to do this is often to talk to a technician you trust.

!!! warning "Unsolicited Support"
    **For your security, we will not initiate a remote support session without explicit permission.** If someone you do not trust contacts you offering remote support, you should decline. You should also decline if you are not requesting support. Allowing unsolicited remote support sessions risks the safety of your computer, of your information, and of your identity.
