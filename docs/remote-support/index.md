# Getting Started with Remote Support

!!! info "Notice"
    Due to licensing issues, **Connectwise Control** is now used to provide most remote support.
    TeamViewer is no longer the preferred option.

# What's changed?

TeamViewer is no longer supporting our use of their software, so we have switched to another solution, ConnectWise Control.
This will help us provide you with the same level of remote support as always, at no extra cost to you.

# How to get help

Before you can join a remote support session, the first thing you will need to do is arrange a time for your session to take place. The best way to do this is often to talk to a technician you trust.

!!! warning "Unsolicited Support"
    **For your security, we will not initiate a remote support session without explicit permission.** If someone you do not trust contacts you offering remote support, you should decline. You should also decline if you are not requesting support. Allowing unsolicited remote support sessions risks the safety of your computer, of your information, and of your identity.

Once you have arranged a remote support session, getting help is easier than ever before with ConnectWise Control. Most of the time, it's as simple as checking your email.

  1. Check your email for a message with the subject **Support has invited you to join a remote support session**.
  1. If you see the message, **open** it.  
    *Note: If you do not see the message, look in your SPAM or Junk folder.*
  1. Click the large **Join Now** button. If you cannot click the button, copy and paste the unique URL under it into your browser's address bar instead.
  1. Follow the instructions on-screen to join your session, or contact your technician for more information.
