# Getting Started with Remote Support

!!! warning "Warning"
    Due to licensing issues, **Connectwise Control** is now used to provide most remote support. 
    TeamViewer is no longer used. See below for more info, or find your operating system to get started.
     
# What's changed?

TeamViewer is no longer supporting the use of their software, so we have switched to another solution, ConnectWise Control. 
This will help provide you with the same level of remote support as always, with no extra cost to you.

# How to get help

Getting help remotely with ConnectWise Control gives you more options than ever before. **Select the option that best describes you**.
